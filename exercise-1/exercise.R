# Exercise 2: Creating data frames
aaaaaa
# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks scored the first 4 games of last season
# Hint: (google "Seahawks scores 2016")

# Create a vector of the number of points the Seahawks have allowed to be scored against them in the first 4 games


# Combine your two vectors into a dataframe


# Create a new column "diff" that is the difference in points


# Create a new column "won" which is TRUE if the Seahawks wom


# Create a vector of the opponents


# Assign your dataframe rownames of their opponents
